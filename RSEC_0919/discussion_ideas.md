- importance of confidence, incentive, motivation
- approaching it from a one-to-one point of view, informed by teaching and reflecting on personal experience
- importance of identity: I am a programmer rather than "I am someone who writes a collection of scripts that kind of work" - how do we move people on?
- sense of belonging / community important from my personal experience. Becoming a software carpentry instructor was a big psychological step: identify as a programmer.
- incentive: software papers. people using your software - a lot of this is unseen - through email. Another reason for encouraging use of issues.
- confidence: it's fine to not know what you're doing.
