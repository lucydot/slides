    "Notes on confidence: Used to work in a prison teahing adult men maths. These are people up to their 60s who have very little confidence in their academic ability, no formal qualification, 40 years since they were last in school. So they're nervous. I have seen much the same behaviour teaching PhD students across several universities in the UK. Coding, programming is one of those things that people tend to find disproportionality scary, that very intelligent people can still for some reason have very low confidence with. An important first step in building confidence is sharing your code. You will find that yes your code isn't perfect, but thats fine, no-one elses is perfect either."
