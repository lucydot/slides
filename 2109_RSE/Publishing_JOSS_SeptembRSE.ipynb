    "Abstract: Publishing your research software project in a peer-reviewed journal can have multiple benefits. This includes: increasing the visibility of your work, easily quantifiable recognition and credit through e.g. citation counts, and using the publication as an indicator for software reliability. Last but not least, the peer review process should lead to better quality software.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, several new research software journals have emerged. In this talk, after outlining the various benefits gained from publishing research software, I will focus on the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). Drawing on my personal experience of publishing in and reviewing for JOSS, I will reflect on how this has improved the quality of software I write, and how we may use the process of software publication to support others' development. I will outline the unique JOSS publishing model that challenges the more \"traditional\" journals, including their fully open, Github-based peer review process. Hopefully you will leave the talk knowing if your work falls within the journal scope, and understanding how to successfully submit your software project."

    "Well we are coming to the end of SeptembRSE. It's been a very packed schedule and I'm so pleased we can play catch up on Youtube. Over the past couple of weeks I've enjoyed watching members of our community report on their work and the tools they are using, and reflecting on better ways for working together with each other. And this is what for me sets the RSE community apart from the other more traditional academic communities I've belonged to - this community is continullay thinking from the small scale (how do I get X to work?) to the large scale (what will this community look like in 10 years?). Now Something which rightly continues to be a big issue for our community is how we get credit for this engineering, this thinking and strategising, how do we get our magic beans? and that is something I'll be looking at today as part of this talk: Publishing your software project with the journal of open source software. This second part is in brackets because although I am going to focus on JOSS in the second part of the talk, much of what I will discuss in the first half is applicable to other new and emerging publishing platforms."
