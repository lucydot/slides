### Notes on giving phonon talks

(Inspired by great talk from Olivier Delaire from Duke)
- start with dispersion: slope=speed, DOS for entropy and thermodynamics, expt from neutrons / Xray / optical
- then potential vs displacement graph
- to calculate phase transitions we also need phonon entropy
- thermal conductivity is important for thermoelectric material design, amongst other things
- phonon lifetime is the most complex one to compute in expression
- The cutoff radius can be important for third order calculations as you do not want to miss important interactions: in SnSe for example, the Sn-Se 011 interactions need to be captures
- on intensity vs energy plot, the width is related to the lifetime (again, see work of Olivier Delaire)
- harmonic have perfect, exact frequencies whilst for highly anharmonic the peaks become wider and wider until there is no longer a well defined quasi particle in extreme cases
- Delaire, Ma, 2011 Nature Materials.

- superionic conductors are delocalised ions above a certain T, with a mobility like molten salt.
- there are order <-> disorder transitions in solid state electrolytes. Disorder is associated with the superionic phase.
- as disorder increases with temperature the phonons are no longer defined (peaks in intensity vs energy transfer become smudged out)
- but even in the superionic phase there are peaks so that you know you do have a solid
