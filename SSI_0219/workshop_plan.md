### Workshop plan

A one-day workshop which will outline key concepts for best practice in research software. There will be time for discussion of challenges around reproducibility and the ways in which we can effectively share our code.

Teaching material will be taken from the ["Get your code publication ready"](https://lucydot.github.io/publication-ready/index.html) workshop which is currently under development.

Before the workshop, participants will be asked to review a software project which has already been published on JOSS / JORS, as this will be used as a case study during the workshop.

Participants will also be asked to bring a piece of code (or perhaps an idea for a piece of code) they think may (one day) be submitted to an open source journal.

We will also try to identify peer mentoring partners in advance of the workshop - researchers who can support each other (eg: through code review) after the workshop.

*Draft workshop outline*  

- Introduction: Why is reproducibility difficult? What options are there for publishing code? 

- Documentation basics: A broad overview
	- Flash presentation: Documentation in R.
	- Flash presentation: Documentation in Python.
	
- *Coffee*

- Testing basics: A broad overview
   - Flash presentation: Testing in R.
   - Flash presentation: Testing in Python.
   
- *Lunch*

- Case study presentation from the authors of the code. What was difficult? / lessons learnt from submission. Questions

- *Coffee*

- Work with peer mentoring partners: Make a plan of action / to-do list. Write a test for their code or write a piece of documentation for code. Organise a time to update each other next.

- Summary: mention that reviewers are also needed.

Notes:  

- If we could get a JOSS editor along to do the introduction or similar that would be great.
- Exact workshop outline will be decided from outcome of questionnaire. We could include a section on writing modular code, though this may be too much to undertake in the time frame.

### Monitoring / Follow-up

- A pre-workshop questionnaire will be sent to participants.
- A short questionnaire will be sent to participants at 6 and 12 months. This will assess whether they use eg: documentation, testing, continous integration more. It will ask how they have shared their code - snippets online, on request, as SI, or whether they have submitted or had a paper accepted to a software journal.
- Could give branded badges, stickers, or similar when they submit or review with JOSS.
- I will encourage those who use the online resources to get in contact with a few details, so that we are aware of wider impact.

### Resources

- When developing resources for the workshop I plan to adapt existing work:
    - Code Refinery (https://coderefinery.org/)
    - Testing module on SWcarpentry (http://katyhuff.github.io/python-testing/)

### Timeline

- July-Oct 2019
	-  attend code refinery workshop
	-  questionnaire to materials scientists (to assess demand)
	-  develop resources for workshop repository (on-going)
	-  recruit (volunteer) instructor
	-  contact a JOSS editor to outline plans and pitch possible collaboration

- Oct-Jan 2019
   - book rooms (London) and advertise
   - recruit (volunteer) helpers
   - identify peer-mentoring pairs
   - build basic workshop website 
   	
- Feb 2020
   - Deliver first workshop (materials specific)

- March-June 2020 
   - Improve workshop structure / resources from feedback
   - Publicise project at collaborations workshop
   - book rooms (Sheffield) and advertise - hopefully, this will be combined with a reprohack organised by Anna (https://rse.shef.ac.uk/blog/opencon_london/).
