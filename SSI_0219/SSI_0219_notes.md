### SSI Fellowship Application 2019

#### INTRO (1min30)
Slide 1: title slide
Hello, my name is Lucy Whalley and this is my application to the SSI Fellowship 2019

Slide 2: Who am I? My research
I am a computational materials scientist. I use high performance computing and solid-state physics to simulate materials on an atomic scale. The hope is that if we understand how the electrons and atoms in existing materials behave, we will be able to design new materials with target properties - for example materials for solar cells with higher light-to-electriciity conversion efficiency - this is the subject of my PhD.

Slide 3: Who am I? My software
I am both a user and developer of software. I use large, highly parallelised code like vasp to run calculations on supercomputers, like Piz Daint. These calculations burn a lot of computer time. these codes output large date files, and I write programmes which try to turn this data into physics. I use the typical python scientific stack (NumPY, Scipy, pandas, pytest), bash, git and have just dipped my toe into Julia.
Effmass is an example of this
Also publish smaller scripts and use Jupyter Notebooks as SI to papers.
I try to work as openly as possible. I publish my code on Github, and just established a workflow for publishing my talks and applications.

Slide 4: Who am I? My teaching
I am a qualified teacher and have taught mathematics in a number of settings: to adults in prisons, to children in primary schools and to. I'm an enthusiastic teacher and enjoy getting people excited about topics they had previously thought were a bit dull. I'm also a software carpentry instructor - but I'll come back to that later.


#### WHAT YOU DO (1min30)

Slide 5: What do I do? I learn
When it comes to building and understanding sustainable software, there's a lot to learn - and it can be hard sometimes to juggle this with the other demands of a PhD. I have found the best way to learn is through attending conferences, like the software carpentry conference, or RSE conference - to meet people in the field and take inspiration from the work they're doing. Last year I set myself the target of publishing a software package with the Journal of Open Source Software, and I learnt a lot from this process. I learnt new to use new tools - like Travis for continuous integration, and I got thoughtful feedback through peer review process which resulted in better tested, better documented code. I've also reviewed for JOSS - again, the main motivation for this was because I would learn something during the process, which I did (MPI data distribution between processors).


Slide 6: What do I do? I teach
As I've mentioned, I'm a software carpentry instructor
I drank the software carpentry Kool-Aid after realising that the instructor training was better quality than my post-graduate teaching qualification.  I'll come back to this later. Pandas, Python in Korea, Python in CDT

Slide 7: I advocate
I consider myself an advocate for best practice in research software, whilst still acknowledging I have a lot to learn about what that means in theory and in practice. I am on the RSE committee. Teh materials event - 40 people.

#### WHAT ARE YOUR FELLOWSHIP PLANS?

I'd like to keep on attending conferences, I'd like to give more talks, and keep on teaching - perhaps taking SWCarpentry to some corners of the UK?...but what I really want to spend time talking about is ...

In my work I have identified a challange:
identified theough people in research team and from swcarpentry and personal experience!
Many people are hesitant to share their code - how can we approach this?
Avoiding single-use software
We need to convince people that with minimum overhead they can achieve this.
- Through work with the RSE team at Imperial, I am aware that there are many scientists who have basic coding skills, but that their code is untested, undocumented and inflexible. Software Carpentry is great for absolute beginners, but there seems little in way of support for programmers who want to move beyond the basic syntax and pursue best practice.
- Experience working with colleagues in materials science (and myself!): "oh, I have a code for that, but it is ugly you wouldn't want to use it" - many versions of the same scripts, unwillingless to share --> results in duplication of work.

This is my proposed solution...
Important to communicate the idea that testing / documentation isn't something advanced to do once perfected basics, but something that will help you develop.
I think the swcarpentry model works, and I think theres demand for it BUT .... - identify the missing step.
Use features of a la SWcarpentry: live coding, open lesson development, collaborative note taking
Do the cycle picture  - not done at the end, but in the middle.
The inventive is a publication - this gives it something to hang off.
Longer term we may need to move past the citation framework.
- Existing projects which teach aspects of coding best practice in a research context have proven impact (https://coderefinery.org/)

Tell me more...
First it will focus on materials - I know the domain and there is momentum from the materials sessions already held.
I've tried to keep the plan flexible. At a minimum visit and invite speakers to the UK.
Put together a day of activities under the banner of "Get your code publication-ready" - I expect I'd do teaching, and have other people interested.
Best: Put together a SWCarpentry module and publish with JOSE.
The resources for this workshop will be developed and maintained on Github (or Gitlab). All resources will be open source licensed. They will be developed using the Software Carpentry template (https://github.com/swcarpentry/styles). The resources will be domain-agnostic.

Who will I work with?
I wouldn't say this is a new idea, I'd say it's remixing a lot of ideas already out there.
