** Add open science page to my website. Include links to a slides page and applications page (to create: Add Japan app and JOSS app). Highlight that important to see failures. Reproducibility: effmass and Jupyter notebooks. Highlight that Open source is a component of open science. What do I need to improve? Publishing code isn't enough: need to document, which hasn't been done. Previous work. Work in development? Look into Mozilla open science course?? **
workshop plan (including workshop website, and motivation about need to think of docu and testing as not something that comes at the end)

### SSI Fellowship Application 2019
Lucy Whalley

#### INTRO (1min30)
Slide 1: title slide
Hello, my name is Lucy Whalley and this is my application to the SSI Fellowship 2019

PART ONE: WHO AM I? (call out: who are you? - Richard?!)

Slide 2: Who am I? My research
I am a computational materials scientist. I use high performance computing and solid-state physics to simulate materials on an atomic scale. The hope is that if we understand how the electrons and atoms in existing materials behave, we will be able to design new materials with target properties - for example materials for solar cells with higher light-to-electriciity conversion efficiency.

Slide 3: Who am I? My software
I am a software user -  I use highly parallelised code, optimised for use on supercomputers.
I am a software developer - the software I write post processes the large data files generated from the supercomputer calculations. I use the typical python scientific stack, bash, git and have just dipped my toe into Julia.
I try to work as openly as possible. For example, I publish my code on Github and use Jupyter Notebooks as supplementary information to papers so that it is possible to reproduce my calculation steps. I have recently started sharing my talks and applications online.

Slide 4: Who am I? My teaching
I am a qualified teacher and have taught mathematics in a number of settings: to adults in prisons, to children in primary schools and to people in cafes. I'm an enthusiastic teacher and enjoy getting people excited about topics they had previously thought were a bit dull. 

#### WHAT YOU DO (1min30)

Slide 5: What do I do? I learn
Last year I attended the RSE conference, CarpentryCon and MozFest. At each I learnt about some of the current challenges and opportunities in the RSE field and got a feel for the community.
I've learnt a lot as an author and reviewer for the Journal of Open Source Software - as an author, I learnt how to use new tools - like Travis for continuous integration, and I got useful feedback through the peer review process.

PART TWO: WHAT DO I DO? (call out: what do you do?)

Slide 6: What do I do? I facilitate
Through software carpentry, I teach programming skills - git, bash and python -  to researchers. I also created a pandas mini-workshop for the Imperial Research Computing summer school last year. I'm currently organising a one day workshop for PhD students in a Centre for Doctoral Training. 

Slide 7: I advocate
Recently, I've started to advocate for best practice in my domain. I am a committee member of the Imperial Research Software community and in this role I organised a research engineering in materials science event. This was well attended - I booked catering for 30, and 40 people turned up - from PhD students to professors, we discussed research software best practice, and how we can better support each other. I gave a talk - "publishing your software project with the journal of open source software".

#### WHAT ARE YOUR FELLOWSHIP PLANS?

PART THREE: WHAT ARE MY FELLOWSHIP PLANS?

Slide 8:
Well, I'd like to continue to attend conferences, perhaps taking a more active role (giving a poster or talk) I'd like to have more speaking opportunities, and I'd like to teach SWCarpentry in some far flung corners of the UK - reach people who are a distance away from the major cities. 

Slide 9:
I've also got an idea!
I got this idea because I noticed that, despite working in a group of computational scientists, 
many people are hesitant to share their code - its untested, its undocumented- it can only be used by one person - and this is a problem because it means we all end up with slightly different versions of the same code - it's inefficient use of researcher time. I call this single-use software, and like the plastic cups, we should be trying to phase it out.

Slide 10:
The solution?
I think we need to incentivise people to test and document their code, to use software best practice. And I think that getting a software paper and citations is a great incentive! So my idea is to use this as a carrot, to structure a workshop with publishing your code as the overall aim.
And it seems to me there is a gap in the market for this workshop. I think Software Carpentry is great for absolute beginners, but there doesn't seem so many workshops which will support for programmers who want to move beyond the basic syntax and pursue best practice.
I recognise that longer term, we may want to move away from a system where academic merit is measured in citations. But in the meantime, I think this is a good idea.


Slide 11:
Who will I work with?

Audience:
The plan would be to work with researchers in materials science initially as there is momentum from the materials science event already held. If it's a success - for example, people start sharing their work more - the workshop could be developed into a SWCarpentry lesson, developed and hosted on Github, and shared with researchers in other fields.

Collaborators:
I know that there has been existing work done along these lines and I don't want to reinvent the wheel...

For example - Code Refinery is a Nordic Project that teaches coding best practice in a research context - I would certainly like to attend one of their workshops to learn more about what they are doing. I've also got interest from some current fellows. 

#### FINAL THOUGHTS

Slide 13: 
Thank you for listening - and if you want more information about the proposed workshop go to this link.

----


Jeremy Cohen is an RSE Fellow who has contacts with Code Refinery, and is interested in being involved with this project.
Adam Jackson, 2018 SSI Fellow, is a materials scientist who I've discussed this with - he may be able to help with part of the workshop development of delivery.
I think this also complements the work that Anna Krystalli is doing around reproducibility - and we have discussed working together.
Finally, there are people who I haven't met, but whose work I have seen online - Yo Yehudi and the codeisscience project which I think aligns nicely, and I also see Alice Harpool has blogged about code publication. It would be great to discuss this with them and see what they think.
