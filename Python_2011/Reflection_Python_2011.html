20 students / 1 helper (Cai) and 1 unofficial helper (Ewan)

What worked?

- Most students (all bar one) had their systems prepared with the necessary installs: the setup instructions and drop-ins had clearly worked.
- The pace seemed about right. I covered the planned content a little quicker than expected (with half an hour to spare). I asked via an anonymous poll whether the speed was too fast, too slow, or just right. 12 students voted just right, 4 voted too fast.
- In the break there were several good questions: about python syntax (quote marks, underscores)
- Break out rooms via Jitsi seemed to work smoothly enough - students found their break out room and seemed to use them ok.
- The "problem solving" Jitsi was well used and Cai did an excellent job catching some people up - I was very pleased to have had a pre workshop discussion with him
- The etherpad was used for questions and somewhat for notes.
- Students were more willing to share their screen and give explanations to the task when they had been working in pairs.
- One student didn't have a chrome book so I setup an empty notebook using the "Binder" service. She accessed this through her web browser - good solution it seems.

What didn't work?

- There was not the same level of interaction as in an in-person class. For the first 1.5 hours (before the break) I was pretty much the only person who had talked! (though SW Carpentry lessons do tend to be teacher-heavy from the style of teaching). Online there is less chance for unplanned informal interactions, it needs to be planned in more explicitly.
- Teams doesn't have some useful features: blackboard next time?
	- It doesn't have break out rooms for pairs tasks (disabled in the Northumbria version for some reason). Instesad I used Jitsi (see above).
	- You can't "freeze screen" during presentations. This was really annoying. It meant I was juggling multiple versions of tabs.
- Not all of the regiostered participants seemed to be actively taking part. There were 20 people in the call but ~14 seemed to be voting, fewer still giving "thumbs up" when asked. Perhaps use the Teams "Together" mode?
- I found not being able to sketch things real time restrictive. Ideally there would be an ipad+pencil setup so that I can sketch and explain? Or perhaps a web-cam centred on a piece of paper for the lower-tech version?
