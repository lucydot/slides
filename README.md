  <summary>Python Parts One and Two, March 2019</summary>

[online slides](https://lucydot.github.io/slides/Python_0319)

Slides for parts one and two of a Python workshop, taught at the University of Bath in March 2019. The course webpage is [here](https://lucydot.github.io/python_novice). The course is an adapted version of the Software Carpentry python novice workshop. It uses plotting UV-Vis data as a motivating example  - so should be better suited to the typical physicist than the original.
