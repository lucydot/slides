Abstract:

I use density functional theory to calculate the electronic and vibrational properties of thin-film photovoltaic materials. The majority of my PhD research has focused on hybrid halide perovskites. These materials are markedly different from their predecessors in photovoltaics – both organic and inorganic (e.g. CdTe, GaAs) – and present a number of simulation challenges [1]. 
Although the carrier concentration in a hybrid halide perovskite under one sun does not exceed 1016cm3, it can reach densities of 1019 cm3 under laser excitation for photoluminescence (PL) studies. I will use Effective Mass Theory to quantify the extent of electronic band non-parabolicity in CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI). I will show that band non-parabolicity has a significant impact upon the optical effective mass, Burstein-Moss band gap shift and carrier mobility in the high carrier density regime [2]. I will also show that the slow thermalisation of above bandgap carriers, observed in PL studies, can be explained by using a classical heat diffusion model to calculate the rate of polaron cooling [3]. 
In the second half of my talk I will consider an imperfect crystal structure where the translational symmetry has been broken with a point defect. I will outline the lattice distortion and electronic localisation incurred when a H-centre (iodine split-interstitial with self-trapped hole) is formed in MAPI [4]. I will present on-going work related to identifying the vibrational states of this defect.

TODO: add in experimental motivation (reference other peoples work!)

Slide 1: Distortions and Defects in Hybrid Halide Perovskites


Slide 2: Materials Design Group

Slide 3: Photovoltaic materials

The sun is a great source of energy, and can be harnessed to move to low-carbon energy. Silicon is really good at what it does, but want to keep lowering cost to make it competitive. The way to do this is to increase the efficiency of the cell. HHP are under developing and promising as cheap. Currently being developed for use in commercial tandem (world record). Despite it's success there is a lot we don't know about this material - it's an active area of research.

Slide 4: Hybrid Halide Perovskites


(CH3NH3PbI3 = MAPI)
(animation: tilting and defects difficult to model, across many timescales, link to perspective)
(I want to talk about 3 things today. The first is related to the concept of effective mass in a degenerate semiconductor)

Slide 5: Non-degenerate semiconductor


(under sun, low carrier density - bands approximated as parabolic --> gives a constant effective mass)
effective mass is a simple model to renormalise, effect of the lattice.
The effective mass a critical parameter in models for the optical and transport properties of a semiconductor. 



Slide 6: Degenerate semiconductor

(under laser excitation, carrier density reaches up to x. the bands fill up and the fermi level pushed into the band.---> now non-parabolic --> effective mass increases)
Experimental measures vary: useful for theory to describe.
What is the extent of band non-parabolicity in MAPI?
To what extent does this affect optical and transport properties?

slide 7: The alpha parameter

alpha parameter of zero: perfectly parabolic
MAPI -perovskie
cdTe another PV material
Use Density Functional Theory to calculate the bandstructure of this material. cite effmass code.
Explain why I expect hole to be non-parabolic than electron

slide 8: the optical effective mass

slide 9: electron mobility

(so the title of my talk is distortions and defects that was my first distortion - a non-parabolic distortion. The second distortion is related to the atomic lattice)

slide 10: Lattice anharmonicity


phonon dispersion, linked to tilting of the lattice.
What affect does this have on optical properties?

Slide 11: Band Gap broadening


Electron-Phonon coupling
Map along the modes to calculate electronic structure. See a band gap broadening in the material.

(now the final section of my talk where I will briefly outline defect)
So far considered distortions in the bulk. But we know that defects induce distortions in the surrounding lattice and through this mechanism they form centres for recombination

Slide 12: Killer defects

Slide 13: V-centres in MAPI 

We have predicted this defect

Slide 14: Summary


Defects and distortions combined
- What is the rate of carrier capture at a defect site?
