5 minute talk


Materials science- we are interested in properties of materials
from atomic (crystalline periodic, inorganic, and hybrid) to properties (solar cells: band gap, transport properties, stability)
To do this use DFT which solves schroginer equation by only conisdering the density of electrons.
But this approach assumes that we have perfect translational symmetry, and that we are 0K. Neither of these things are true!
so my research considers: materials where translational symmetry has been lost, and at finit temperature

- defects. these are important but they break our symmetry. postulate that this exists.

- temperature. effect on band gap, rate of electron cooling

- can combine these things. Defects at finite temperature: vibrational defects.
