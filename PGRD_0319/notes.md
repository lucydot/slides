5 minute talk

Hello my name is Lucy Whalley and I am in the Materials Design Group led by Professor Walsh
I am a computational materials scientist and I simulate materials on an atomic scale using high performance computing resources like the national supercomputer Archer.
My aim is to understand how the atoms and electrons in existing materials interact, and then the hope is that we can use that understanding to design new materials with target properties - such as a photovoltaic material which will efficiently convert energy from the sun into electrical energy.
On the right here I have split this process, converting light into electricity, into three key steps.
The first step is that the sunlight must be absorbed into the material and it must generate an electron and a hole.
The second step is that we should be able to separate this electron and hole - in some materials, particularly organic materials, you can generate an electron-hole pair but they like to stay bound to one another.
The third step, after charge separation, is that the electron and hole must be able to transport through the material and reach the electrode, where they can be extracted to an external circuit.
This is the step that my research focuses on. And the material family of interest is the hybrid halide perovskites, which have caused great excitement over the last decade as they are able to complete this process efficiently but can be synthesised at relatively low cost.

So we can ask which physical properties or processes c an limit electron transport. And our answer could be split into two parts: those which are intrinsic to the material, and those which are extrinsic - those which we just have to live with, or those which could potentially be controlled for, could be engineered out.

One intrinsic limitation is the effective mass of the electron. Heavier electrons moving through the material will have a lower mobility - ideally we want a material with nice 'n' light electrons.
My research has shown that at high electrons concentrations, the effective mass increases significantly due to a distortion of the electronic bandstructure.
For example, the dashed line here gives the effective mass in the [100] direction in MAPI, a type of hybrid halide perovskite. At a concentration of 10^20 the effective mass in this direction doubles.
This effect would not be seen in a standard solar cell where the electron concentration would be around 10^16, but you could start to see this effect in a concentrator solar cell, where the suns rays are magnified through a lens, and you could see it in photoluminescence studies.

One extrinsic factor which can limit electron transport is the quantity and type of point defects in the lattice. 
Defects can limit electron transport because they are able to trap electrons and holes so that they are unable to move through the lattice.
By point defect, I that there could be a missing atom in the perfectly repeating crystal lattice, which we call a vacancy, or that there is an extra atom which we call an interstitial.
My research has that an iodine interstitial will bond to a lattice iodine and that the molecular dimer which is formed is able to trap a hole - that is shown here, this is the unpaired electron localised around the iodine dimer.
This also forms the basis for my on-going research, where I am trying to calculate rate of hole capture at this site.
