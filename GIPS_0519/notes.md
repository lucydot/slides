Take some pictures of the research group in action.



# part one: my work as a computational materials scientist

- I use computers
- I use computers to understand materials
- Why do you care about materials?
	- New Materials......faster computers, longer life batteries, more efficient solar cells
- Why do you care about computers?
	- We can simulate materials. This is easier than synthesising materials. Like a lab in a computer. Use the laws of QM

- This is the magical equation. This is it! This is what explains how everything around us behaves.
- Dirac quote. We just need to solve it
- Easies!
- ....not so easy
- there are too many dimensions. It's too big.
- Q.M: superposition
- We need to make some estimations: DFT
- run simulations....but we need big computers
- fifth fastest in the world. Need own power station. Burn a lot of energy. Fast as the human brain!

- then we can understand how the electrons and atoms behave....then we can predict whether material will fall apart, how heat will travel through, how conductive it is....

# part two: my life as a scientist

Perhaps you are interested in science

four parts: queen of the world, I have no idea what I'm doing, I'm tired, I'm excited (but never bored)
places I've been



- climate change. I think its the biggest question.
- The March - great. radio show: I bet they'll go on a flight. They'll do it for other things.
- not just scientists: everyone.
- is there anything you care strongly about? how might your interests make a difference




- The evening takes place at the Mills Centre, Highgate School, 5pm - 7pm.

- The age group of the audience is 14-17 yo and the girls are all from Highgate School and from over 30 partner state-schools. The evening takes the structure of a talk by the first guest, followed by refreshments, and then a talk by the second guest. The talk should last 25 minutes, with 5-10 minutes for questions afterwards. It would be fabulous if you could tell us what your research is about and also how you got there (school, uni, PhD) and also about your past experience as primary school teacher! Any of your own personal advice on pursuing a career in Physics/engineering is much appreciated :).
- Yes, there will be a projector for the slides. I'd kindly ask you to either bring your talk on a USB stick or to send your slides over so I can store them in the system. 
- Send slides the day before
