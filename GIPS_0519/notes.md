# girls in physics series

Take some pictures of the research group in action.

Who am I?
Lucy: Newcastle (photo from when I was young)
Hackers --> Uni in Birmingham ---> trained as teacher (prisons, primary school) ---> study again at Imperial 

# part one: my work as a computational materials scientist

- I use computers
- I use computers to understand materials
- Why do you care about materials?
	- New Materials......faster computers, longer life batteries, more efficient solar cells
- Why do you care about computers?
	- We can simulate materials. This is easier than synthesising materials. Like a lab in a computer. Use the laws of QM

- This is the magical equation. This is it! This is what explains how everything around us behaves.
- Dirac quote. We just need to solve it
- Easies!
- ....not so easy
- there are too many dimensions. It's too big.
- Q.M: superposition
- We need to make some estimations: DFT
- run simulations....but we need big computers
- fifth fastest in the world. Need own power station. Burn a lot of energy. Fast as the human brain!

- then we can understand how the electrons and atoms behave....then we can predict whether material will fall apart, how heat will travel through, how conductive it is....

# part two: my life as a scientist

Perhaps you are interested in science

four parts: queen of the world, I have no idea what I'm doing, I'm tired, I'm excited (but never bored)
places I've been

what keeps me going?
- questions I care about
- reason I didn't continue
- subjects you find interesting are good, but
- its the people who make connections
- you may not know until you are older

- climate change. I think its the biggest question.
- The March - great. radio show: I bet they'll go on a flight. They'll do it for other things.
- not just scientists: everyone.
- is there anything you care strongly about? how might your interests make a difference
