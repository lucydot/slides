- The age group of the audience is 14-17 yo and the girls are all from Highgate School and from over 30 partner state-schools. The evening takes the structure of a talk by the first guest, followed by refreshments, and then a talk by the second guest. The talk should last 25 minutes, with 5-10 minutes for questions afterwards. It would be fabulous if you could tell us what your research is about and also how you got there (school, uni, PhD) and also about your past experience as primary school teacher! Any of your own personal advice on pursuing a career in Physics/engineering is much appreciated :).
- Yes, there will be a projector for the slides. I'd kindly ask you to either bring your talk on a USB stick or to send your slides over so I can store them in the system. 
- Send slides the day before
