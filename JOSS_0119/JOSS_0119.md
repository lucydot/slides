From the [JOSS guiding principles](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reviewer_guidelines.html#guiding-principles)

> "We like to think of JOSS as a ‘developer friendly’ journal. That is, if the submitting authors have followed best practices (have documentation, tests, continuous integration, and a license) then their review should be rapid."

<!--s-->

Why should I submit to JOSS?

<img src="https://github.com/lucydot/slides/raw/gh-pages/JOSS_0119/images/person.png"  width="100" />  

- published paper and citations
- an "excuse" to learn new tools
- peer review process brings increased confidence
- good way to promote your code to the community

<!--s-->

Why should *we* submit to JOSS?

<img src="https://github.com/lucydot/slides/raw/gh-pages/JOSS_0119/images/people.png"  width="180" />

- well-documented and well-tested software freely available to the research community
- reproducibility
- article: ["The Scientific Paper Is Obsolete"](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-scientific-paper-is-obsolete/556676/)

<!--s-->

JOSS is growing

<!--s-->

A JOSS paper contains...

> - A list of the authors of the software and their affiliations
- A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience
- A clear statement of need that illustrates the purpose of the software
- A list of key references including a link to the software archive
- Mentions (if applicable) any ongoing research projects using the software or recent scholarly publications enabled by it

...not a lot!

<!--s-->


The JOSS review criteria

- Software license
- Statement of need
- Functionality
- Installation instructions
- Community guidelines
- **Tests**
- **Documentation**

<!--s-->

Tests in effmass

The testing pyramid with a code snippet for unit and integration tests and the pytest and travis CI logos, Jupyter notebook.

<!--s-->

Documentation

tutorials / explanation / reference
Jupyter / research paper or RTD / RTD

#### Final thoughts

- Other relevant journals: [www.codeisscience.com](http://www.codeisscience.com/journal_table.html)
- JOSS are always looking for new reviewers
- Possible ways to support each other? --> workshops, code review, mentoring.
